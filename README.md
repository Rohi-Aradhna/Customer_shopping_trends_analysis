# Customer_shopping_trends_analysis
This project analyzes customer shopping trends using Python, SQL and Power BI. The dataset includes demographics, purchases, product details, subscriptions, discounts, and shipping preferences. Through structured queries, I examined revenue patterns, product performance, discount impact, and customer segmentation to inform strategic decisions.
